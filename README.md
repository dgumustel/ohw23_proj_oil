# Oil spill Monitoring: Segmentation of Satellite Imagery

## Team Members
Amanda D., Maria G., Jos√© G., Jaelyn Bos, Anand Sekar

## Description
The main idea of this project is to automate the process of identifying a possible oil slick in a satellite image, which involves these main steps: 
 1. Loading: Reading the satellite image file(s)
 2. Cropping: efficient pre-processing, such as a simple statistical analysis (e.g. histogram), to identify possible oiled areas and crop them into patches
 3. Segmentation: segment the oiled areas from the patches
 4. Presentation: visualize the segments: make a list, save metadata
